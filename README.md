# PYGLET
Home for spontaneous python applets: pyglet.

## Origin
Upon discovering a gap in my public repositories and based on my old habits of creating a single repository for multiple projects, pyglet was born.


Pronounced piglet, as a play on 'py' in python and 'let' in applet; this repository seeks to be a reference of python applet successes and attempts.

## Contents

In the spirit of this repository, the contents should be refired directly.

A note or two might be helpful here on repositories of note.

 - hello

Given, there are hardly any projects of note.
